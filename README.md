# telegram-rejoin-private-channels

If you are subscribed to 500+ channels, Telegram will silently unsubscribe you from the old ones. If it were private channels with you as admin and the only subscriber, you will not be able to rejoin them. They will not be shown in the search. Channel name on reposts won't be clickable. Same with group chats. If they are private and you were the only admin, noone can put you back, because there are be no admins!

Fortunatelly, you can find and rejoin lost channels and groups with this script. Definetelly works for channels and groups created by you. Not tested for others.
